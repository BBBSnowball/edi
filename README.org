* What is EDI?
EDI is a hackerspace automation system designed to be, well, hacker
friendly :)

Build around an AMQP Server and small /Apps/. Customize EDI by
editing code not XML files.

Most Apps are written in python followed by bash and Clojure. A
library for python is included as well as a helper tool to easily
connect shell scripts.

** Concept
*** Open
- Develop with /any/ programming language
- No access control to keep people out
*** KISS
- Loosely coupled subsystems with simple tasks
- Keep state local
- Each subsystem runs as own process
*** Message-based
- Subsystem communicate via messages
- Broker routes messages
*** Distributed
- Subsystems can run /anywhere/

** Features
- IRC Bot
  - sed substitution
  - karma
- User Presence
- login
- logout
  - eta
- Help
- Automation
  - DMX Lamp control
  - 433Mhz
  - MPD
- Text-to-speech
- Init System
  - Room shutdown, startup
- Greetings
  - TTS: /Hello User/ once a user logs in
- Gimmicks
  - Weather
  - Fortune

* Documentation

** Features
*** OPEN jabber bot
- user same msg exchange as irc bot
- Possible routing keys: "jabber.recv.raw" "jabber.send.raw"
*** OPEN calendar integration: source
- Repeatedly parse calendar files. Ideally iCalendar. Load from Caldav?
  google calendar?

**** Variants
***** Calendar Commands
- Calendar contains EDI commands. Tool emits commands at specified
  times.
- Alternative to cron + emit_cmd script
- Could be useful to build an alarm clock
***** Events
- Event :: Something is going to happen at a point in time. Wie das
           digitale Zeitalter..

*** OPEN set irc topics/modeline
- Calendar events like Smalltalks
- Something like the emacs modeline?
*** OPEN Voice Recognition
**** Idea
Speech to text. At least in english. Perform natural language
processing to extract meaning. Generate commands.

**** Tools, Ideas
***** pocketsphinx
pocketsphinx is a cpp implementation of sphinx, smaller and not java.

- debian/ubuntu packages: https://launchpad.net/~dhuggins/+archive/cmusphinx
- transformations:
  - we can't recognize users by voice.
  - "!say" not nice to say. instead:
    - "user command <user> <command>"
    - "UC <user> <command>"
    - "command <command>
    - "do <command>"

- "EDI: command say foo"
- "EDI: user command seri login"
- "EDI: user command seri logout"
- "EDI <TONE> "

***** wit.io
- natural language processing web app
- does the text -> meaning part
- exports sphinx language models

**** integration
***** msg
- recv :: voice recognition with some custom transformations
- send :: notify.audio?
***** asterisk
- .. we can recocnize users by callerid
- login by phone?
- desktop edi voice clients based on SIP
